# At-issueness experiments
This repository contains the materials, results, figures and partly the analyses of a series of experiments that investigated the relation between discourse expectations and at-issueness.

The folder "experiments" contains all stimuli and files required to run the main study (in main) and 4 follow-up pilots (in pilot) on Pavlovia. All studies are created with the software PsychoPy.
