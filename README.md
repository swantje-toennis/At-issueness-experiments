## At-issueness studies (conducted by Swantje Tönnis & Judith Tonhauser)
This repository contains the materials, results, figures and partly the analyses of a series of studies that investigated the relation between discourse expectations and at-issueness. 

**Hypothesis:** The more the question answered by content c of utterance U is expected in the context preceding U, the more c is at-issue.

**Method:** We measured the expectedness of question answered by c (see Tönnis and Tonhauser (2022) for another application of this method), and then tested whether it correlated with bottom-up measures.

The folder "experiments" contains all stimuli and files required to run the main study (in "main") and 4 follow-up pilots (in "pilot") on Pavlovia. All studies were created with the software PsychoPy.

The folder "results" contains the results (raw data, preprocessed data), figures of the results, and R scripts for cleaning the raw data, creating figures, and (for the main study) analysis.

#### Study 1: At-issueness of complement (CC) of factive verbs ([experiment](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/experiments/main), [results](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/results/main))
* 30 Stimuli from Vaiksnoraite et al. (2019) each consiting of a context and a target sentence with one out of 5 factive verbs embedded under entailment cancelling operator *perhaps*.
* Part I: Expectectedness was measured for question answered by embedded complement.
* Part II: Projection of complement of factive verb. According to the gradient projection principle, the complement should project to the degree that it is not at-issue (Tonhauser et al. 2018).
* No correlation of at-issueness and question expectedness was found.
  
#### Follow-up pilot 1: Relative expectedness/aboutness ([experiment](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/experiments/pilot/aboutness%20pilot), [results](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/results/pilot/aboutness%20pilot))
* 30 Stimuli from Vaiksnoraite et al. (2019) each consiting of a context and a target sentence with one out of 5 factive verbs embedded under entailment cancelling operator *perhaps*.
* Part I: Relative expectedness comparing the expectedness of the next sentence being about the subject of the target main clause (MC) or the subject of the target embedded complement clause (CC).
* Part II: Projection of complement of factive verb. According to the gradient projection principle, the complement should project to the degree that it is not at-issue (Tonhauser et al. 2018).
* No correlation of at-issueness and MC/CC subject expectedness was found.

#### Follow-up pilot 2: Clear contrast wrt. expectedness ([experiment](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/experiments/pilot/controlled%20stimulus%20%26%20inquiry), [results](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/results/pilot/controlled%20stimulus%20%26%20inquiry))


#### Follow-up pilot 3: Appositive relative clause + continuation rating ([experiment-part1](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/experiments/pilot/quick_pilot_arc), [experiment-part2](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/experiments/pilot/quick_pilot_arc-part2), [results](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/results/pilot/quick_pilot_arc))

#### Follow-up pilot 4: Appositive relative clause + preference rating ([experiment](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/experiments/pilot/preference_arc), [results](https://github.com/swantje-toennis/At-issueness-experiments/tree/main/results/pilot/preference_arc))
